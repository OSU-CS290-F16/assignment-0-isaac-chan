			For this first assignment, the only struggle I had was trying to ignore an HTML tag inside text, specifically the "img" tag. It was not resolved so I enclosed it in quotes instead. I mostly utilized <a href="http://werbach.com/barebones/barebones.html">this link</a> for formatting. I'm already familiar with github so that was not a challenge. 
			One question that was raised while completing this assignment is that I don't know an appropriate environment to develop HTML in. I've been doing it in Notepad++ and viewing the HTML files in Chrome but there should be a better way. Overall this was a good intro assignment, especially as a review for people unfamiliar with github.
